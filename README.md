# A large collection of dangerous malware.

**Note:** Many malware samples here are very DANGEROUS. I would not recommend using any of these on your host PC, nor running these on a friend's PC for a "prank". The only folder worthy for pranking is the Jokes folder. Everything in there can be reversed by restarting your PC. Other than those, I am not responsible for any damage caused by these samples. Good luck.

*Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/DaBigNerd/Malware/releases) section and download Malware.zip. You will need WinRAR or 7-zip to extract them.*
