# Malware

**DISCLAIMER:** Almost all malware samples in here are malicious. I would not recommend using any of these on your host PC, nor running these on a friend's PC for a "prank". The only folder worthy for pranking is the Jokes folder. Everything in there can be reversed by restarting your PC. Other than those, I am not responsible for any damage caused by these samples. Good luck.
